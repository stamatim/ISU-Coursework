## Problem 1

The augmented feature vector is $x =[1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 1]^T$

## Problem 2

The class of the sample is $+1$

## Problem 3

Start with the regular loss function $\mathbf{J(W)}$, then multiply $y_i^2$ which will always have a value of $1$ regardless of the class label

$$J(\mathbf{W}) = \sum_{i=1}^N (\mathbf{W}^T\mathbf{x}_i'' -1)^2 $$

## Problem 4

The equation for the new loss function is $\mathbf{W} = (X''X''^T)^{-1}X''$

## Problem 5
